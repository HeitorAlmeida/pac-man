# Overview

A Pac-Man implementation in Unity (C#), aiming to respect the original controls and movement of the title character and offering the possibility of adding custom stages.
The behaviors of ghosts, however, don't follow the originals. I just gave them different levels of aggressivity.

# Controls and Movement

In Unity, it's relatively simple to make a character move within walls. What's interesting in this work is the fact that I reproduced the way pac-man is controlled and moves in the original game. It's a very constrained movement that was, at the time, produced by hardware and software restrictions, and that proves a little bit tricky to implement within a modern engine, that gives so much freedom of movement by default.  

# Stages

Stages can be created with simple text files written very intuitively. There's a specific digit corresponding to each kind of tile that can be used to make a stage, and you can understand them all in a glance at one of the available stage files.

# Art (?)

I drew the (few) sprites the game required.
